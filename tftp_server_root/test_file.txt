The early history of Pallars, which was the easternmost extent of Basque settlement,[3] is linked to that of its western neighbour, Ribagorza.
 Both territories, nominally lands of the Moors, came under the sway of the count of Toulouse perhaps as early as 781,[4] perhaps as late as the start
  of the 9th century. They formed in turn a new province attached to Toulouse and therefore became Carolingian vassals.
A widely-circulated monkish account of 1078 from Alaó contains the earliest foundation myth of any of the counties of the Hispanic March.
 Written at a time when the independence of Pallars and Ribagorza was threatened by the hegemony recently created by the personal union of the Kingdom
  of Navarre and Kingdom of Aragon (1076). It records that Count Bernard and Bishop Ato, both of Ribagorza and descended by tradition from Charlemagne,
   spearheaded the conquest and repopulation of Sobrarbe and Pallars respectively and that the bishop held ecclesiastical rule over all three counties.
