The dinar (Cyrillic script: динар) was the currency of the three Yugoslav states: the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (formerly the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), the Socialist Federal Republic of
 Yugoslavia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia between 1918 and 2003. The dinar was subdivided into 100 para (Cyrillic script: пара). There were eight distinct dinari, with hyperinflation in 
 the early 1990s causing five revaluations between 1990 and 1994. Six of the eight have been given distinguishing names and separate ISO 4217 codes.
